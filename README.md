Hello Here is where u will find Infos about the actual state, why i code this and other infos about it

Why This: {
    uhm... so i really like Chemistry as a Subject in school so i tried to do this in adction to learn and understand how JSON DataBase Works 
    so i Made it cause i really like to make an Periodic Table coding in JS and i Wanted to understand and starting codding with .json
}

Actual State: {
Very Adaptative with Little Bugs (Mostly on Mozzila(probaly because of it's Engine i think.
it seems to do not wait a "Promise" of loadding Table and push to get elements before load all table )).

A Better Design 
Adaptative Design (very Flex Design)
}
